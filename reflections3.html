			<h2>Reflection 3: First Web Application using Github and Heroku</h2>
			<p><style> p {text-indent:50px;t}</style>In the 3rd week of our User Design Class, the struggle continues. And I can say that our
group is one of the groups that is really struggling. Our first idea which was the Body Mass Index
(BMI) calculator was denied due to the lack of resources, specifically professional help. Because
of our mindset of relying only on secondary sources of information, we have disregarded the
need for the opinions of a professional which is highly important especially on projects
concerning the health of actual people. Our group struggled on creating ideas that got turndown
one after the other. Then we thought of an application that we thought would be really cool if it
actually was made. It was an app concentrated on trading like the old days. Without relying on
any money, you could barter off your old things for other second-hand used stuff. It was really
an application which we would use ourselves. That is why I was really shocked when my group
mates told me that it was denied. It was a good thing that we were still given the chance to push
forward and the project was approved. Perhaps the only problem in our group is the lack of
motivation when push comes to shove. As long as we continue to persevere, we can surely finish
this project.</p>
            <p>Another thing that I was able to do this week is my own very first webpage. And because
it was my first it is far from what I expected it to be. The font sizes were too large, the menu was
cut-offed at the end and other problems I couldn&#39;t fix due to the lack of my knowledge. And
because we have to venture on our own in learning HTML and CSS for web development, it
really wasn&#39;t a peaceful stroll in the park. More like it was a dessert full of booby traps where
every time I got caught in a mistake, I go back to square one. Well, I was able to complete the
webpage, but it was only a webpage, it literally had one page. That is why the plan is to continue
learning more about this topic that I don&#39;t have any idea of online, so I can only not satisfy for a
passing grade, but I could satisfy myself also.</p>
