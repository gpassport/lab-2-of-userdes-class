			<h2>Reflection 4: Userinyerface - Worst UI Practice</h2>
			<p><style> p {text-indent:50px;t}</style>I was dismayed on this Monday morning, there was no jeep going straight near our
school, and I took a cut trip but still couldn&#39;t get a ride. I was worrying if I could take my quiz
even if I was late. Even if my score was deducted it was enough to leave me satisfied. I arrived
almost half of the time for our class was over. All my classmates were done from the quiz, and I
was wondering they weren&#39;t even worried about what was their scores. Then my seatmate told
me that I could still take the quiz. I was determined to finish it as soon as possible. But when I
opened the website, I was completely shocked. The texts were all misspelled and the buttons
were all misplaced or not highlighted properly. It was extremely confusing, you would waste
time on finding the right button to click, and waste more time to clicking something by mistake.
Where the captcha was both tiring and misleading. I was panicking the whole time and didn&#39;t
know what to do. The only strategy I had was to read first then look at places where you least
expect the buttons to be placed. I finished slower than I expected to be done, but at my next run
it was smooth sailing and I scored better than the first try.</p>

            <p>This just shows how the user interface is extremely important, simply placing the right
buttons and texts greatly influences how the user interacts with the application. Misplacing a
description of a button could lead to an immediate mistake to the user, or could lead them to
discontinue using the application. And as a future software developer, this opens my eyes more
on being able to recognize the dis and don&#39;t on user interface design. By simply making the user
not notice the design of the app shows how successful you are in making them comfortable with
your application.</p>
